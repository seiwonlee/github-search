            <h4>Getting Started</h4>
            <p>Sensei is a true native application template for Angular and is distributed as a CLI project. In case CLI is not installed already, use the command below to set it up. </p>
            <div lang="markup">
                <pre class=" language-markup">
                    <code class=" language-markup">
npm install -g @angular/cli

</code>
                </pre>
            </div>
            <p>Once CLI is ready in your system, extract the contents of the Sensei zip file distribution, cd to the directory, install the libraries from npm and then execute "ng serve" to run the application in your local environment.</p>
            <div lang="markup">
                <pre class=" language-markup">
                    <code class=" language-markup">
                    cd Sensei
                    npm install
                    ng serve

                    </code>
                </pre>
            </div>
            <p>The application should run at http://localhost:4200/, you may now start with the development of your application.</p>
            <h4>Important CLI Commands</h4>
            <p>Following commands are derived from CLI.</p>
            <div lang="markup">
                <pre class=" language-markup">
                    <code class=" language-markup">
                    Run 'ng serve' for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

                    Run 'ng generate component component-name' to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive/pipe/service/class/module`.

                    Run 'ng build' to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

                    Run 'ng test' to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

                    Run 'ng e2e' to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).

                    Run 'ng help' for more options.
